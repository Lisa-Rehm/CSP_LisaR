        <h1>The Parts of the Brain</h1>
        <div id="top">
        <h2 class="head">Basic Overview:</h2>
        <p>The brain is made up of many components each with their own specific role. We don't know a lot about the brain compared to it's complexity, but we do know what the basic areas specialize in.</p>
        <h4 class="head">Gray Matter and White Matter:</h4>
        <p>The Brain is made up of white matter and gray matter. Gray matter is on the outside of the brain and is mostly responsible for processing information. The white matter is on the inside of the brain and is mostly responsible for transmitting information all over the nervous system.</p>
        <h4 class="head">The Three Main Sections:</h4>
        <p>The brain can be divided into 3 basic sections: the brainstem, cerebellum, and cerebrum. The cerebrum is the largest section, making up most of the brain. It is comprised of gray matter and white matter. The cerebrum is responsible for conciousness, emotions, reasoning, problem-solving, memory, and voluntary movement. The brainstem is in the bottom-middle area of the brain and it connects the cerebellum to the spinal cord. It is made up of the midbrain, pons, and medulla and works as a messenger between the brain and the rest of the nervous system. Finally, the cerebellum is a small part of the brain located at the back of the head between the cerebrum and the brainstem. It is responsible for coordinating voluntary movements, maintianing posture, balance, and equilibrium.</p>
        <h4 class="head">Lobes:</h4>
        <p>In the cerebrum there are four lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. The frontal lobe is the largest and it located at the front of the brain. It is responsible for planning, decicion making, problem solving, recognition of smell, motor control, language, and social behavior. The parietal lobe is located on top of the brain, between the frontal and occiptal lobes. It deals with identifying objects, spatial awareness, interpreting pain and touch, and helps to understand spoken language. The temporal lobes are at the sides of the brain and they are responsible for short-term memory, speech, musical rhythm, and some smell recognition. Finally, the occiptal lobe is located at the back of the brain, just above the cerebellum. It is responsible for your vision and performs function such as visuospatial processing, distance and depth perception, color determination, object and face recognition and memory formation.</p>

        <h2 class="head">Brodmann Areas Explained:</h2>
        <p>The Brodmann Areas are a system of naming and numbering small areas of the brain. It allows us to explain and see more of the individual and specific functions in the brain.</p>
        <h4 class="head">List of Some Brodmann Areas:</h4>
        <img src="https://www.simplypsychology.org/wp-content/uploads/brodmanns-areas-1536x864.jpeg" alt="Brodmann Areas">
        <dd>Image from: https://www.simplypsychology.org/brodmann-areas.html</dd><br>
        <dl>
            <dt><b>Areas 1, 2, and 3:</b></dt>
            <dd>These areas make up the primary somatosensory cortex. Somatosensory means all sensations that can be felt anywhere throughout the body and don't involve the five primary senses. So these areas allow you to sense things like pressure, pain, temperature, and where you feeling it. These areas also help for more skilled and coordinated movements as well as motor learning.</dd>
            <dt><b>Area 4</b></dt>
            <dd>This area is the primary motor cortex so it is necesaary to be able to move and coordinate movements.</dd>
            <dt><b>Area 9</b></dt>
            <dd>This area is the dorsalateral prefrontal cortex which is responsible for "higher" cognitive functions. These functions include organization, planning, working memory, abstact reasoning, attention and motor planning. </dd>
            <dt><b>Area 17</b></dt>
            <dd>This is the primary visual cortex and it is lovated in the occipital lobes. It is specialized for processing both static and moving objects as well as pattern recognition.</dd>
            <dt><b>Area 21</b></dt>
            <dd>This area is the middle temporal gyrus and it is one of the ridges of the temporal lobes. It is believed that this area is reponsible for language processing, verbal and mental arithmetic processing, sound recognition, and semantic retrieval and memory. Semantic just refers to words and our abilities to process and apply meaning to them.</dd>
            <dt><b>Area 22</b></dt>
            <dd>This area is the superior temporal gyrus and it has a role in both verbal and non-verbal communication. It is considered that Wernicke's area is located here which is a refion commonly associated with the production of language as well as language comprehension. This area contributes to both object and space-related information, processing non-verbal cues, auditory short term memory, and the production of speech.</dd>
            <dt><b>Areas 23, 24, 28, and 33</b></dt>
            <dd>These areas make up the cingulate gyrus which is a large arched fold above the corpus callosum, which is the part of the brain that connects the two hemispheres. It is a part of the limbic system which is the system most involved in emotional processes and emotion and pain regulation. This part is believed to be involved in the way people avoid negative stimuli mostly in accordance with fear and in the body's concious response to unpleasant experiences. It also plays a role in memory as it learns to avoid negatice consequences.</dd>
            <dt><b>Areas 44 and 45</b></dt>
            <dd>These areas make up Broca's area which is located within the frontal lobes. It is an essential region for the production of language. It is able to put together elements of language, selct information from a variety of sources, and help produce information about the motor movements required for spoken and written language. It helps construct and process complex sentences and speech patterns.</dd>
