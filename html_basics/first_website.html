        <h1>The Parts of the Brain</h1>
        <h2>Basic Overview:</h2>
        <h4>Gray Matter and White Matter:</h4>
        <p>The Brain is made up of white matter and gray matter. Gray matter is on the outside of the brain and is mostly responsible for processing information. The white matter is on the inside of the brain and is mostly responsible for transmitting information all over the nervous system.</p>
        <h4>The Three Main Sections:</h4>
        <p>The brain can be divided into 3 basic sections: the brainstem, cerebellum, and cerebrum. The cerebrum is the largest section, making up most of the brain. It is comprised of gray matter and white matter. The cerebrum is responsible for conciousness, emotions, reasoning, problem-solving, memory, and voluntary movement. The brainstem is in the bottom-middle area of the brain and it connects the cerebellum to the spinal cord. It is made up of the midbrain, pons, and medulla and works as a messenger between the brain and the rest of the nervous system. Finally, the cerebellum is a small part of the brain located at the back of the head between the cerebrum and the brainstem. It is responsible for coordinating voluntary movements, maintianing posture, balance, and equilibrium.</p>
        <h4>Lobes:</h4>
        <p>In the cerebrum there are four lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. The frontal lobe is the largest and it located at the front of the brain. It is responsible for planning, decicion making, problem solving, recognition of smell, motor control, language, and social behavior. The parietal lobe is located on top of the brain, between the frontal and occiptal lobes. It deals with identifying objects, spatial awareness, interpreting pain and touch, and helps to understand spoken language. The temporal lobes are at the sides of the brain and they are responsible for short-term memory, speech, musical rhythm, and some smell recognition. Finally, the occiptal lobe is located at the back of the brain, just above the cerebellum. It is responsible for your vision and performs function such as visuospatial processing, distance and depth perception, color determination, object and face recognition and memory formation.</p>
