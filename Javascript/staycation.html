        <p>Rainbow Bridge National Monument is a sacred land structure to the nearby Native Americans. It was first 'discovered' by white men in 1909 but the Natives have known of it for hundreds or even thousands of years. It was formed over hundreds of years when a horseshoe bend in the river was shortcutted by erosion through a canyon wall. This 'fin' in the canyonwall that it went through became the bridge. (see sixth image on the left). It is possible, though dangerous and tedious, to hike to the bridge, but using a private, rental, or tour boat is typical.</p>

        <p>Please be respectful when visiting the Rainbow Bridge. It is very sacred to many Native American tribes in the area, including: the Hopi Tribe, Kaibob Paiute Tribe, Navajo Nation, Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe, Pueblo of the Zuni, and the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe. It is asked that visitors do not walk under or directly up to the Bridge because of this.</p>
