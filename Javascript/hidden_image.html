        <h1>Chickens</h1>
        <p>Chickens are very good animals to have. They take care of themselves just as long as you provide them with food and water. They can make a lot of noise, but hens are a lot quieter than roosters. Egg laying chickens will provide you with lots of eggs, especially in the summer, where many lay 5 out of 7 days a week. Chickens also have a lot of personality and if you hand raise them, they will follow you around and love you for years.</p>

        <p>But which chickens should you get? Unless you want to eat your bird, don't get meat chickens. There are many layer varieties, all of them have their own pros and cons. Pros include hardiness (the ability to withstand hot or cold temperatures), good egg production, and friendliness. Cons include an inability to withstand extreme temperatures, bad egg production, and unfriendliness. Depending on your goals, broodiness could be good or bad. It's bad when all you want is eggs, because broody birds don't lay eggs. It is good if you want to raise chicks, because very broody birds will be more likely to be good mothers. Frequently broody varieties are also often more friendly.</p>
